# LLM Loop Rules

1. Do the first unchecked todo item, validate your work, then mark it complete
2. Add new todo items if more work is needed
3. Write research findings to `research/` and reference them when completing tasks
4. After completing work, write a git commit message and commit your work
5. Create `.done` file when all todos are complete
6. Update `CHANGELOG.md` after completing tasks
7. Only do the first unchecked subtask under parent tasks
