# LLM Loop Rules

- Do the first unchecked todo item, validate your work, then mark it complete
- Never ask for confirmation to do a task, just do the most logical thing
- Add new todo items if more work is needed
- Write research findings to `research/` and reference them when completing tasks
- After completing work, write a git commit message and commit your work
- Create `.done` file when all todos are complete
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` after completing tasks
- Only do the first unchecked subtask under parent tasks
