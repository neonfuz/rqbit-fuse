***CRITICAL*** Read the tasks file, do the first item on the checklist, and then edit the checklist to check the item off the list. Do not ask if you should do it, just do it.
***CRITICAL*** After doing an item, write a git commit message to the .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG file about what you did
***CRITICAL*** After each step, if you think it requires more work then add more todo items to the end of the list
***CRITICAL*** When you do research, write your findings into a new file in the 'research' subdirectory and make a reference to it in the checklist after checking the item off the list
***CRITICAL*** If you are done with every item in the checklist, create an empty file in the root directory named .done
