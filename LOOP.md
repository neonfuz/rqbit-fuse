***CRITICAL*** Read the tasks file, do the first item on the checklist, and then edit the checklist to check the item off the list. Do not ask if you should do it, just do it.
***CRITICAL*** After doing an item, write a git commit message to the .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG file about what you did
***CRITICAL*** After each step, if you think it requires more work then add more todo items to the end of the list
***CRITICAL*** When you do research, write your findings into a new file in the 'research' subdirectory and make a reference to it in the checklist after checking the item off the list
***CRITICAL*** If you are done with every item in the checklist, create an empty file in the root directory named .done

    - test_read_operation_timeout: Proper timeout behavior
  - Criterion benchmarks compile successfully:
    - cache_throughput (insert/read_hit/read_mixed)
    - inode_management (allocate/lookup/parent_child)
    - concurrent_operations (cache reads, inode ops)
    - memory_usage (cache overhead, inode manager)
  - All 88 tests passing (76 unit + 12 integration + 10 performance)
  - No clippy warnings in performance code
- [x] Add CI/CD (completed)
  - Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with comprehensive CI pipeline
    - Runs tests, clippy, and formatting checks on PR/push
    - Tests on both Linux (Ubuntu) and macOS
    - Generates code coverage reports with cargo-tarpaulin
    - Includes cargo dependency caching for faster builds
  - Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
    - Builds release binaries for 5 platforms: Linux x86_64-gnu/musl/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64
    - Creates GitHub releases automatically on version tags
    - Publishes to crates.io with CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret
  - Next: Need to set up required secrets (CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN, CODECOV_TOKEN) in GitHub repo settings
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md (required by release workflow)
  - Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
  - Documented all features in the initial release
  - Added security section with key protections
  - Linked to GitHub compare URLs for version tracking
- [x] Add security audit workflow with cargo-audit
  - Created `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` with cargo-audit and cargo-deny
  - Runs daily via cron and on all PRs/pushes to main
  - Created `deny.toml` configuration for license/advisory checking
  - Added MPL-2.0 to allowed licenses for option-ext dependency
  - Documented security findings in `research/security-audit.md`
  - Ignored RUSTSEC-2025-0134 (unmaintained rustls-pemfile via reqwest)
  - 2 security advisories identified: rustls-pemfile (unmaintained), fuser (unsound)
- [x] Add dependabot configuration for dependency updates
  - Created `.github/dependabot.yml` with comprehensive configuration
  - Enabled Cargo (Rust) dependency updates with weekly schedule
  - Configured smart grouping: patch updates, fuse deps, async deps, serde deps, http deps
  - Enabled GitHub Actions workflow updates
  - Set up automatic labeling and reviewer assignment
  - Reference: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- [x] Add Windows build support to release workflow (RESEARCHED - see research/windows-build-support.md)
  - [x] Research WinFsp (Windows FUSE implementation) installation in CI - WinFsp available via chocolatey
  - [x] Research cross-compilation or native Windows builds - native builds recommended
  - [x] Evaluated `fuser` crate Windows compatibility - NOT SUPPORTED
  - [x] Determined Windows support requires major refactoring or alternative approach
  - **Decision**: Windows not supported; document WSL2 as alternative
  - Research findings: `research/windows-build-support.md`
- [x] Document Windows limitations in README
  - Added "Platform Support" section with Linux/macOS/Windows support matrix
  - Documented WSL2 as Windows alternative with setup instructions
  - Explained technical reasons (fuser crate doesn't support Windows)
  - Located in README.md after Prerequisites section
- [x] Fix test compilation errors from file_count Option change
  - Fixed compilation errors after making file_count: Option<usize>
  - Updated test assertions to wrap file_count in Some()
  - Fixed test_list_torrents_success to mock /torrents/1 endpoint
  - All 98 tests passing (76 unit + 12 integration + 10 performance)
- [x] Investigate P0: Multi-file torrent directories appear empty at runtime
  - **FIXED**: Modified `get_children()` in `src/fs/inode.rs` to use fallback when children vector is empty
  - Root cause: DashMap's lock-free nature caused children vector writes to not be immediately visible
  - Fallback now triggers when children list is empty, not just when parent isn't a directory
  - All 98 tests passing (76 unit + 12 integration + 10 performance)
  - See FIXES.md for full details
- [x] Fix P1: Stats API mismatch causing warnings (see FIXES.md)
  - **FIXED**: Updated `TorrentStats` struct to match actual rqbit API v1 stats endpoint
  - Changed struct to use `snapshot` (with `downloaded_and_checked_bytes`, `total_bytes`) and `download_speed` fields
  - Updated `TorrentStatus::new()` to calculate progress_pct from bytes
  - Updated trace logging and tests to use new structure
  - All 98 tests passing, no clippy warnings
  - Warning spam eliminated - API responses now deserialize correctly
